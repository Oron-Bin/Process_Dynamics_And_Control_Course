# Process Dynamics and Control Course

## Overview

### Course Description
This repository contains materials and projects for the Process Dynamics and Control course. The course focuses on the design and implementation of control systems for various applications using different design methods. The projects are implemented and simulated in Simulink.

### Projects
1. [Project 1: Camera Positioning Control System](#project-1-camera-positioning-control-system)
2. [Project 2: Tank Height Control System](#project-2-tank-height-control-system)
3. [Project 3: Acoustic Conductor Control System](#project-3-acoustic-conductor-control-system)

## Project 1: Camera Positioning Control System

### Description
Design a control system for camera positioning using the circle design method. This project involves creating a control system that accurately positions a camera based on predefined criteria.

### Key Features
- Utilizes the circle design method for control system design.
- Implementation and simulation in Simulink.

## Project 2: Tank Height Control System

### Description
Design a control system for regulating the height of liquid in tanks using the state-space method. This project involves developing a control system that maintains the desired tank height despite disturbances.

### Key Features
- Utilizes the state-space method for control system design.
- Implementation and simulation in Simulink.

## Project 3: Acoustic Conductor Control System

### Description
Design a control system for managing sound waves in a one-dimensional acoustic conductor. This project involves creating a control system that optimally controls sound wave propagation.

### Key Features
- Utilizes advanced control methods for acoustic wave management.
- Implementation and simulation in Simulink.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Process-Dynamics-And-Control-Course.git
    cd Process-Dynamics-And-Control-Course
    ```

2. Ensure you have MATLAB and Simulink installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Project_X  # Replace X with the project number (1, 2, or 3)
    ```

2. Open the Simulink model file (`.slx`) in MATLAB.

3. Run the simulation to observe the designed control system in action.
